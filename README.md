# GameOfThrones-Social-Network-Analysis

In this analysis, I have explored social network analysis of major characters from A Storm of
Swords which is the third of seven novels in A Song of Ice and Fire [Game of Thrones], a fantasy series by
American author George R. R. Martin. George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series stands among
the most richly imagined fantasy sagas of our time. The books are populated by hundreds of characters
enmeshed in a complex web of alliances, loyalties, histories and conflicts. We have tried to change this
complex story into an interaction network.

Following **analytical questions** are being answered using network analysis:
1) Who is the most important (i.e. “influential” , “dominating “or “important”) person overall?
We investigated character importance using five distinct centrality measures.
a) Degree
b) Eigen Vector
c) Closeness
d) Betweenness
e) Page Rank.
2) Community Detection: We applied community detection to determine the division of the network
into coherent communities.
3) Identifying central actors in each community based on closeness and degree centrality.
4) Identifying the male to female ratio for separate communities.
